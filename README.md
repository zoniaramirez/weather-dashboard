# Weather Dashboard

This weather dashboard was created for travelers that want to see the weather outlook for multiple cities so that they can plan their trip accordingly.

## Description

This weather dashboard was created as a challenge for bootcamp students to apply everything that was learned in module 6 of class. The challenge will make this app run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS. This app functionality will be achived by using third-party APIs and making requests with specific parameters to a URL to retrieve the data.

## Acceptance Criteria

    - Having a source code.
    - Given a weather dashboard with form inputs.
    - When a city is searched you are presented with current and future weather conditions for that city.
    - After city is searched it is stored to the search history.
    - When you view current weather conditions for that city you are presented with city name, date, icon representing weather conditions,         temperature, humidity, and wind speed. 
    - When you view future weather conditions for that city you are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays date, icon representing weather conditions, temperature, windspeed, and humidity.
    - When you click on a city in the search history you are presented with the current and future weather conditions for that city.
